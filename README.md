# YouTube CLI Chatbot

This project aims to develop a command-line interface (CLI) powered chatbot for YouTube, utilizing the YouTube Search API. The chatbot enables users to search for videos, ask questions about the video and its content, and even summarize the video.

## Problem Statement

In today's digital age, YouTube serves as one of the largest repositories of information, entertainment, and educational content. However, navigating through this vast sea of videos can sometimes be overwhelming. Many users often find themselves spending a considerable amount of time searching for specific videos or information within videos. Additionally, users may want to gain insights or summaries of videos without having to watch them entirely.

To address these challenges, our goal is to build a CLI-powered chatbot that leverages the YouTube Search API. This chatbot will empower users to:

1. Search for videos based on specific keywords or topics.
2. Ask questions about the video and its content.
3. Summarize the video to provide key insights and information.

By creating this chatbot, we aim to streamline the process of interacting with YouTube content, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Search Videos**: Users can search for videos using keywords or topics.
- **Ask Questions**: Users can ask questions about the video and receive relevant answers.
- **Summarize Videos**: Users can request summaries of videos to obtain key insights and information without watching the entire video.
